#Machine Learning using Python
##Part-2
Before going to the actual machine learning, let us know some of the python tools and libraries that help us in building a machine learning model.
Data exploration and Analysis
For data exploration and analysis in python we use the below libraries.
Pandas

Pandas is the most popular python library that is used for data analysis. It provides highly optimized performance with back-end source code is purely written in C or Python.
2. Numpy
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
3. Seaborn
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Using this visualization methods you can visualize and use the parameters for your machine learning model.
4. Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. This also can be used for the visualization.


Using the below link you can access to the github repository which helps you to understand these concepts with example of Iris data set.
